This is a simple tutorial on how to save a plot as an image file in R/RStudio.



# Data

For this demo, I'll use the (Palmer Penguins data set)[https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins].

The data include various measurements of three species of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago.

If you haven't already, you'll need to install the package `palmerpenguins` to use the data.

```{r install_penguin_data, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
require(palmerpenguins)
```


# Creating a figure

I'll make a conditional boxplot of body mass conditioned on species and sex.  

Don't worry if you don't know what that means.  The focus of this walkthrough is saving plots to files.



```{r base_version, fig.width=8}
require(palmerpenguins)
boxplot(
  body_mass_g ~ sex * species, 
  data = penguins,
  # names = 
  #   paste(
  #     levels(penguins$sex),
  #     rep(levels(penguins$species), each = 2),
  #     sep = "\n"),
  xlab = "",
  names = NA,
  ylab = "body mass (g)",
  las = 2
)
mtext(
  levels(penguins$species),
  side = 1,
  at = 1:6,
  # at = 2*1:3 - 0.5,
  line = 1.5)

mtext(
  levels(penguins$sex),
  side = 1,
  at = 1:6,
  line = 0.5)

```



```{r ggplot_version, eval = FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
require(palmerpenguins)

# ggplot(mander, aes(x = Sex, y = SVL, fill = Site)) + 
ggplot(mander, aes(x = Sex, y = SVL, fill = Site)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Salamander Snout to Vent Length")

ggplot(subset(penguins, !is.na(sex))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(
    x = species,
    y = body_mass_g,
    fill = sex)) +
  xlab("species") +
  ylab("body mass (g)")

```




<!-- My RStudio session will look something like this: -->

<!-- ![r session](../figures/mander_svl_boxplot.png) -->



# Save the figure method 1

Notice that above the plot there is a button that says *Export*.
Click there and choose whether you want to save the image as a `.pdf` or `.png` file.


# Save the figure method 2

You can also save a figure directly using code in R.  I prefer this method becuase you can more easily specify the options that you want to use for the image.

The image will be saved as the `filename` that you provide.  The image will be saved in your **current working directory**.

The syntax is slightly different than what you're used to.  You have to use `png()` on the line before your plotting code.  You have to place `dev.off()` on the line after your plotting code.


```{r, eval = FALSE}

# This tells R to start an image file:
png(filename = "salamander_boxplot.png")

# These lines create the plot.
# You won't see the plot in the RStudio plot window.
ggplot(mander, aes(x = Sex, y = SVL, fill = Site)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Salamander Snout to Vent Length")

# This tells R to finish creating the image file and save it.
dev.off()
```

`png()` has lots of options (see the help entry).  For example, you can specify the height and width of the output image (in pixels).

I'll now have a file called **salamander_boxplot.png** in my current working directory.

The best way to learn is to try it!
